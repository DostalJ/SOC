\section*{Introduction}

\noindent Social networks are the most common source of the news and information nowadays. Information abundance on social network is too extensive that it is frequently reduced. The selection of posts is performed by preferential algorithms that examine users interactions on social networks to predict which posts will be more liked by them. The selection is based on a users previous behaviors.Even though those search engines potentially can expose users to content variety and more diverse viewpoints, they rather expose users to a homogeneous  news content and lead them to a so called \textit{Filter bubble}.The term was coined by Eli Pariser in 2011. The filter bubble represent a space in which users are exposed to news, posts and information from like-minded persons and are completely isolated from different opinions. This phenomenon not only causes individuals distorted view, furthermore, it can lead to a biased perception of the world and society radicalisation.
